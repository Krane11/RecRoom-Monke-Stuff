im pretty sure the person who made this RockPikMin888 Tell me if im wrong.                   
when ur in ur dorm on ce go to float and search -9.81 there should be around 300 values just use ctrl a to select all of them and change them, u can meess around with this al ittle bit to see how it works but changeing it to 0 u float with out moving up or down. positive mubers make go up, and negativr numbers make go down. if u jump with it as a hugh number u teleport.
