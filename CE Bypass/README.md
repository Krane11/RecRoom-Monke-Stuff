# CE
 This will teach u how to use ce on rec room either using WinD64 or EFIguard
 U can use any Custom Cheat Engine u want but this one i made and is Undetected https://anonfiles.com/ucaec7Gcy5/bin_rar if u dont know how to use anon files just dont download it as an iso.
 U can  either use WinD64 https://github.com/katlogic/WindowsD/releases or Efiguard https://github.com/Mattiwatti/EfiGuard
 If using WinD64 U cant have valorant if u do uninstall riot client open it then type y then n
 open ce and turn on all of the settings in extra then press ok it should say dbk64 loaded
 Run WinD64 and uninstall it if it doesnt give u that option go to syestem32 and delete the WinD64 file it made
 Then just connect to recroom and u can use cheat engine to do stuff
